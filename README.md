# Machine Learning: Interpretability Methods

## Overview
This document explores the interpretability of machine learning models, focusing on the methods of Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE). The empirical example involves predicting loan repayment using a random forest model, known for its limited interpretability.

## Presentation of the Application

### Data and Model
The dataset includes various factors like gender, credit history, education, etc., contributing to predicting loan repayment. A random forest model, considered a black-box model, is employed for its predictive capabilities. The document delves into understanding the model's behavior using PDP and ICE.

## Conclusion and Limitations
The study highlights the importance of interpretability in machine learning models and introduces PDP and ICE methods. While PDP provides a global understanding of average feature effects, ICE delves deeper into individual observations, uncovering potential complexities. The empirical example demonstrates the application of these methods to a credit approval prediction model, emphasizing their strengths and limitations. The document concludes by acknowledging data limitations and the need for cautious interpretation in real-world applications.
